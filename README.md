# newsletter
This is the repository we use to keep track of all newsletters written and distributed within the LabDAO community. Using git to manage writing and editing processes might not be the most natural choice for most folks, so let's go through why we think this is a good tool and how to get the most out of using it. 

## Why we use git to write
Git is a version control system designed to facilitate collaboration between software develops. It is the best tool to enable a large group of contributors to agree on a shared truth and contribute in a decentralized way. Software developers communicate with computers using code - Writers communicate with humans using natural language. In a decentralized community, like LabDAO, keeping track of activities publicly ensures maximum inclusivity. We want everybody to be able to contribute in the writing process and open pull requests with changes. Even though there will most likely always be a team focused on the task of writing a newsletter, doing it out in the open with everybody able to suggest structured improvements is important. Instead of hiring members, like in a traditional company, we simply onboard organic contributors.

## How we use git to write
Git can be a bit finicky. The easiest work with it is to go to the labdao/newsletter repository in your browser and press the "." button. This will open an IDE where you can edit the article and commit your changes. If you and others want to work on the repository at the same time, the best way to do this is to use hackmd.io, a collaborative markdown editor that feels like github and google docs had a baby. You can save your results on hackmd.io and push your changes to Github.
