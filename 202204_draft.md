# LabDAO Newsletter No. 2
Gm! Welcome to the second edition of LabDAO’s monthly newsletter! LabDAO was created just a few months ago, and we have so much going on in the community. By putting things in one place, we hope it will be easier to keep up with all of LabDAO’s moving parts. You can expect updates on LabDAO community news, events, and new developments in the ecosystem. As always, we welcome any feedback, comments, or suggestions!

## What is LabDAO?
LabDAO is a decentralized organization made up of individuals from across the world working to accelerate life science innovation and collaboration. We are building an open-source and community-owned protocol where users can exchange research services, and find collaborators.

## Technology News

### Openlab
The technology group at LabDAO have been hard at work building out our protocol, openlab, and a set of first services. You can follow the development and contribute at github.com/labdao. Our command line interface for the openLab protocol is undergoing development by Rick Smith Unna. Check out a current demo here

### Feedback Needed
Do you know a scientific tool that has a poor web user interface? Let us know [here](https://github.com/labdao/gui-wrapper/issues/2). We are working on wrappers to improve user experience of existing tools.
